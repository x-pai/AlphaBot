# 🤖 AlphaBot - Your Intelligent Stock Analysis Assistant

> "In the stock market, it's not the smartest who make money, but the most disciplined." — Warren Buffett (probably never said this, but sounds right)

## 🎭 When AI Meets the Stock Market: A Battle of Rationality and Data

Welcome to the world of AlphaBot, where you'll find not just cold data analysis, but also heartwarming trading advice. We know you're using this application because:

- 📉 Last month's trades made you question your life choices
- 🧠 Your trading decisions are often guided by "I feel it will go up"
- 💸 You excel at "buying high and selling low"
- 🎰 You treat the stock market as a giant casino (and the house always wins)

Don't worry, we've all been there. AlphaBot was born to help you evolve from a "feeling-based trader" to a "data-driven investor."

## 🛡️ Disclaimer (Serious Face)

**Important: Before using this project, please confirm you understand the following facts**

1. **This is not a money printer**: This project cannot guarantee you'll become the next Buffett or Simons. If it could, we'd already be retired in the Maldives.

2. **Market risks**: Stock markets are risky, proceed with caution. Remember, the market is always right, even when it seems irrational.

3. **AI makes mistakes too**: Our AI models are smart, but they can't predict earthquakes, coups, or your neighbor suddenly deciding to sell all their stocks.

4. **User responsibility**: If you lose money after using this software, remember that you pressed the "buy" button, not us.

5. **Data sources**: We use data from third parties; if the data is wrong, it's really not our fault.

**By using this project, you agree to: maintain a smile regardless of profit or loss, because at least you gained valuable experience.**
